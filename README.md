# Hand-Gesture Controlled 2D Platformer Game

This project is the final training project for a Computer Vision course. The aim of the project is to control a character in a 2D platformer game using real-time hand gestures detected through a laptop camera. We utilize the Mediapipe library for hand gesture recognition and integrate it with a Unity game via socket communication.

## Project Overview

The project consists of two main components:

1. **Hand Gesture Detection (Python)**
   - A Python script uses Mediapipe to capture hand movements via a webcam and translates specific hand gestures into control commands for the game.
   - The detected hand gestures are mapped to basic movement commands: `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`, and `stop`.

2. **2D Platformer Game (Unity)**
   - A simple 2D platformer game built in Unity using open-source assets from the Unity Asset Store.
   - The character in the game moves based on the commands sent from the Python script after processing the hand gestures.

### Key Features:
- **Real-time Hand Gesture Detection:** Uses Mediapipe to detect hand movements, with gestures corresponding to different character controls.
- **Socket Communication:** The Python script sends the detected gesture as commands to the Unity game via a socket.
- **2D Platformer Game:** The Unity game features a simple 2D environment where a player character navigates based on hand gestures.
  
## System Architecture

1. **Hand Gesture Detection (Python):**
   - Using the laptop's camera, the Mediapipe library detects hand landmarks and identifies specific gestures.
   - Based on predefined gestures, the Python script translates the hand movements into commands (`up`, `down`, `right`, `left`, `stop`).
   - These commands are sent via a socket to Unity in real-time.

2. **Unity Game (C#):**
   - The Unity game listens for commands over a socket connection.
   - Upon receiving the movement command (e.g., `up`, `right`, etc.), the character in the game moves accordingly.

## Setup Instructions

### Requirements

#### Python (Hand Gesture Detection)
- Python 3.x
- Mediapipe (`pip install mediapipe`)
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- Socket library (already included in Python standard library)

#### Unity (2D Platformer)
- Unity 2021 or later
- Unity assets (open-source assets used from Unity Asset Store)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/Izzat-Kawadri/Hand-Gesture-Controlled-2D-Game.git
```

2. **Python Environment Setup:**
   - Install the necessary Python libraries:
```
    pip install mediapipe opencv-python
```

3. **Unity Project:**
   - Open the Unity project located in the /UnityGame folder using the Unity Editor.

4. **Socket Communication:**
   - Ensure the Python script (`hand_gesture_control.py`) and the Unity game are running on the same machine or network so they can communicate via socket.

### Running the Project

1. **Start the Unity Game:**
    - Open the Unity project and press the Play button in the Unity Editor.

2.  **Start the Python Gesture Detection Script:**
    - Navigate to the python folder in the repository.
    - Run the Python script for hand gesture detection:
```
    python hand_gesture_control.py
```
   


3. **Control the Game:**
    - Use hand gestures in front of your camera to move the character in the game:
       - Raise hand up for "up" command.
       - Lower hand down for "down" command.
       - Move hand right for "right" command.
       - Move hand left for "left" command.
       - Hold hand still for "stop" command.

### Customization

  - You can modify the hand gesture-to-command mappings in the Python script (hand_gesture_control.py).
  - The Unity game can be expanded with more levels, mechanics, or assets from the Unity Asset Store.
